# Welcome

Welcome to the SLAC Shared Scientific Data Facility (S3DF). The S3DF is a compute, storage and network architecture designed to support massive scale analytics required by all SLAC experimental facilities and programs, including LCLS/LCLS-II, UED, cryo-EM, the accelerator, and the Rubin observatory. The S3DF infrastructure is optimized for data analytics and is characterized by large, massive throughput, high concurrency storage systems. Over the next decade, S3DF will deploy a few PFLOPS of CPU computing, tens of PFLOPS of GPU computing, hundreds of petabytes of fast storage, and more than two exabytes of archiving capabilities.
