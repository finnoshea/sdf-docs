# S3DF Business Model

## Rules of Engagement

### Storage

Each group can contribute to /sdf/data and /sdf/scratch by funding the
acquisition of flash-based and spindle-based storage. We will procure,
install, and configure your newly acquired hardware and we will
integrate it with the existing infrastructure. We will maintain the
hardware for at least 5 years from the acquisition and we will cover
the file system licensing costs.

In addition, S3DF will provide high speed, flash-based systems for
/sdf/{home, sw, group} and provide the relative backups. See the
[storage section](data-and-storage.md) for a description of the
different S3DF file systems.

### Compute

Each group can contribute hardware to the interactive pools and to
SLURM. The hardware for the interactive pools is dedicated to the
group.  Contributions to the SLURM batch system will grant the funding
group a number of computing hours corresponding to the hardware they
buy for up to 5 years. For this approach to work, we will deploy a
banking mechanism that keeps track of the number of hours each group
spends on each SLURM partition.

In addition, S3DF will be able to provide some number of hours on several of the
SLURM partitions to all groups, independently of their contributions.
Talk with us if you need SLAC-funded hours for your group.

Contributing groups can also purchase dedicated resources for long
running services and for the real-time and fast-feedback stages in the
data flow.

### Hardware

In order to mininimize the variety of hardware we need to support,
contrubuting groups will be able to only select models from a fixed
menu. This menu will include one or two models of CPU servers, a
low-end GPU, one high-end GPU, one flash-based server, and one
spindle-based JBOD model. This menu will be updated ~annually to
reflect changes in technology.


## Overhead

All contributions will fund the actual hardware plus 15% overhead for
spares, installation and infrastructure costs. The S3DF team decides
how to spend the overhead. The overhead is not due for deployments
that fund the entire infrastructure - that entails spares, installation
labor, racks, cables, and network devices.
