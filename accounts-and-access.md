# Accounts and Access

## How do I get access to SDF? :id=access

If you are a SLAC employee, affiliated researcher, or user facility user, you are eligible for a SDF account.

!> SDF uses Windows Active Directory for authentication.  Both a SLAC unix and windows account are needed, although you will be logging in to SDF with your windows password.

As we transition from our legacy authentication technologies, you will need a SLAC ID to utilise SDF (The SLAC ID account is the same as our SLAC Windows account):

You can use our [Accounts Portal](https://ad-account.slac.stanford.edu) to view your SLAC accounts and their status (eg, you can verify if you have a SLAC Windows account and if its status is Enabled or Disabled).

If you do not already have a SLAC Windows account, you can...

- If you already have a SLAC Unix account, you can request one automatically one through our [Accounts Portal](https://ad-account.slac.stanford.edu). Once it has created a SLAC ID you may have to wait up to 30 minutes for some of the backend systems to verify your account. When you can [ssh into SDF](#ssh) then your SDF account is ready!

or...

- Your SLAC sponsor can request a SLAC Windows account at this [Service Now Link](https://slacprod.servicenowservices.com/it_services?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=17176b676ff12100aae0c6012e3ee4f7&sysparm_category=d65827c46fd921009c4235af1e3ee434) (SLAC login required)

!> __Please Note:__ If this is the first time you are using SDF, after creating your [SLAC ID](#access) you will need to [ssh](#ssh) into our systems prior to anything else (including launching [jupyter](software.md#jupyter) etc.) so that our automated setup can finish configuring your home directories etc. for you.

Your SLAC sponsor or SLAC colleague who already has access to SDF is able to discover when an account is ready in SDF with this command on sdf-login.slac.stanford.edu: getent passwd [username]
```
[user@sdf-login01 ~]$ getent passwd ksa
ksa:*:6862:1051:Amrhein, Karl:/sdf/home/k/ksa:/bin/bash
``` 
if there is no response from that command, then the username is not ready. When you see a response, the user should be able to log in.
 
we also have a script:
```
/usr/bin/listusers
```
to list all known users in AD (although it won’t tell you if the account is disabled or not, we can still use ‘res’ command on rhel6-64.slac.stanford.edu for that)

## How do I log onto SDF?

You can access SDF via [SSH](#ssh) or via a [web portal](interactive-compute.md) using your SLAC credentials.


## How do I SSH?  :id=ssh

We recommend that you connect to our load balanced SSH service at

```
sdf-login.slac.stanford.edu
```

Otherwise, you can also log in individually to one of our current pool of servers at

```
sdf-login01.slac.stanford.edu
sdf-login02.slac.stanford.edu
sdf-login03.slac.stanford.edu
sdf-login04.slac.stanford.edu

** Please note that these hosts are rebooted the first Sunday of every month at 4am Pacific Time.
```

### Using a Terminal

You can use any SSH client, such as [OpenSSH](www.openssh.com) or [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) and use the Standard TCP port 22 to connect to the servers above.

The following example shows us using the `ssh` command to login to one of the SDF SSH login servers. It asks for our password (which we enter, followed by `Enter`) and shows a successful login.

?> The `$` character in terminal prompt examples signify your input prompt and provides an example of the command you should type in the text preceeding it.

```bash
$ ssh sdf-login.slac.stanford.edu
ytl@sdf-login02.slac.stanford.edu's password:
<enter SLAC password>

### Using Open Ondemand :id=web-terminal

If you do not have a terminal handy (or one of the applications mentioned above), you can also use our [interactive](#interactive) logon to launch a web-based terminal using [Open Ondemand](https://openondemand.org/):

[Launch web based terminal to SDF](/pun/sys/shell/ssh/sdf-login.slac.stanford.edu ':ignore').

After you click on the above link, you may be asked to log in - redirecting you to our Windows SAML ADFS authentication service where you can enter your username and password. You may be asked for a '2 factor' authentication using Duo. As long as you keep your web browser open, or are not using your browsers private browsing feature, you should only need to authenticate again about once a day.

?> We are currently working on providing delegated access to SDF such that you can use [CILogon](https://www.cilogon.org/) to authenticate with your home institution's computer account so that you need not have to log on with your SLAC account. Please [Contact Us](contact-us.md) if you are interested in this.

From there, you will be presented a prompt for your password, just like as [above](#using-a-terminal).



## How do I access my group/collaboration's data?

SDF uses Unix POSIX groups for access. All existing Unix groups from centos7.slac.stanford.edu or rhel6-64.slac.stanford.edu are available in SDF. To view all groups known to SDF, you can use this script:
```
[user@sdf-login01 ~]$ /usr/bin/listgroups 
```

To view all groups you are a member of, you can use this command:
```
id
```
To view all groups that someone else is a member of, you can use this command:
```
id [username]
```
(replace [username] with the username you wish to look up. The output includes the GID (Group ID) and group name.  The GID is the significant part and it's what controls access; the group name is just a convenient way for humans to refer to the GID without remembering numbers.



## How do I check current status of storage quotas?

You might want to know how much of your quota is used; reaching the limit might be the cause of some weird error messages for example. To do so, simply type the following command in a Terminal window:
```
/sdf/sw/sdf-quota.sh
```



## Great! What now?

!> __TODO__ add some links and describe

- determine where your data is
- see what compute resources are available to me
- launch a batch job
- buy more storage or compute
- transfer my data in/out of SDF
