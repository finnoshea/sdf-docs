## S3DF Public Access to User and Group Space 

S3DF can make specific folders publicly available through HTTP. If
you need this service, create a folder called public_html under your
home and send a request to s3df-help.

If you are the PoC of an S3DF facility, you may request this service
for your organization as a whole by creating a public_html folder
under /sdf/group or /sdf/data and sending a request to s3df-help.

See the table below for the naming convention of how these spaces will
appear on the web. Note: eventually, requests for these links will be
managed via [coact](https://s3df.slac.stanford.edu/coact).

| Access 	| Address | 
| :--- | :--- |
| Public group data | https://s3df.slac.stanford.edu/data/&lt;groupname&gt;|
| Public user data | https://s3df.slac.stanford.edu/~&lt;username&gt;|
